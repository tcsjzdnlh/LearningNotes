We’re happy to have shipped Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 (grab a copy here!).
This is a quick glance at the Visual C++ bugs 
resolved that were reported on the Microsoft Connect portal.
We have fixed 330 Connect and VS Feedback bugs 
in the compiler frontend, backend, and libraries; 
and an additional 30 bugs in the IDE 
for Visual Studio 2015 Update 2.

These bugs were submitted by the users in the community.
Although we didn’t fix every reported customer issue(yet!), 
we appreciate that our customers take the time to file bugs on our product, 
and we try to prioritize the bugs 
that come from the community.
If you encounter issues while using our compiler, 
please file bugs!
It helps us know which issues should have the most attention.
