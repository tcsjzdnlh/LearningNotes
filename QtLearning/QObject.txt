Q_ENUM(... )
This macro registers an enum type 
with the meta-object system. 
It must be placed after the enum declaration 
in a class that has the Q_OBJECT 
or the Q_GADGET macro.
For example:

  class MyClass : public QObject
  {
      Q_OBJECT

  public:
      MyClass(QObject *parent = 0);
      ~MyClass();

      enum Priority { High, Low, VeryHigh, VeryLow };
      Q_ENUM(Priority)
      void setPriority(Priority priority);
      Priority priority() const;
  };

Enumerations that are declared with Q_ENUM 
have their QMetaEnum registered in the enclosing QMetaObject. 
You can also use QMetaEnum::fromType() to get the QMetaEnum.
Registered enumerations are 
automatically registered also 
to the Qt meta type system, 
making them known to QMetaType 
without the need to use Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(). 
This will enable useful features; 
for example, 
if used in a QVariant, 
you can convert them to strings. 
Likewise, 
passing them to QDebug will print out their names.
This function was introduced in Qt 5.5.
