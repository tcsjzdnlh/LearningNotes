Detailed Description
The QStyle class is an abstract base class that encapsulates the look and feel of a GUI.
Qt contains a set of QStyle subclasses that emulate the styles of the different platforms supported by Qt (QWindowsStyle, QMacStyle etc.). By default, these styles are built into the Qt GUI module. Styles can also be made available as plugins.
Qt's built-in widgets use QStyle to perform nearly all of their drawing, ensuring that they look exactly like the equivalent native widgets. The diagram below shows a QComboBox in eight different styles.
