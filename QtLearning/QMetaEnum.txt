Detailed Description
The QMetaEnum class provides 
meta-data about an enumerator.

Use name() for the enumerator's name. 
The enumerator's keys 
(names of each enumerated item) are returned by key(); 
use keyCount() to find the number of keys. 
isFlag() returns whether the enumerator 
is meant to be used as a flag, 
meaning that its values can be combined using the OR operator.

The conversion functions 
keyToValue(), 
valueToKey(), 
keysToValue(), 
and valueToKeys() 
allow conversion between the integer representation of an enumeration
 or set value and its literal representation. 
 The scope() function returns 
 the class scope this enumerator was declared in.
