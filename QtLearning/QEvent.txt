class QEvent

Detailed Description
The QEvent class 
is the base class of all event classes. 
Event objects contain event parameters.
Qt's main event loop (QCoreApplication::exec()) 
fetches native window system events from the event queue, 
translates them into QEvents, 
and sends the translated events to QObjects.

In general, 
events come from the underlying window system 
(spontaneous() returns true), 
but it is also possible to manually send events 
using QCoreApplication::sendEvent() 
and QCoreApplication::postEvent() 
(spontaneous() returns false).

QObjects receive events 
by having their QObject::event() function called. 
The function can be reimplemented in subclasses 
to customize event handling 
and add additional event types; 
QWidget::event() is a notable example. 
By default, 
events are dispatched to event handlers 
like QObject::timerEvent() 
and QWidget::mouseMoveEvent(). 
QObject::installEventFilter() allows an object 
to intercept events destined for another object.
The basic QEvent contains 
only an event type parameter and an "accept" flag. 
The accept flag set with accept(), 
and cleared with ignore(). 
It is set by default, 
but don't rely on this 
as subclasses may choose to clear it in their constructor.

Subclasses of QEvent 
contain additional parameters 
that describe the particular event.
